## Technical Debt Strategy
So far, we've dedicated 15% of the total time (around 15 hours) to technical debt related tasks, in particular code review.
From the next sprint, we've decided to split these 15 hours in the following way:
- 5 hours for code review
- 5 hours for bugfixing
- 5 hours for refactoring

### Issues handling Priority
The highest priority is for issues in the code related to the most important user stories: since the Technical Debt handling has started later in the process, the earlier stories must be completed first.

Additionally, the priority for "code smells" handling in between the stories is handled by category, from the highest to the lowest:
- Security
- Reliability
- Maintainability

In between the categories, the priority is handled according to the issue severity.

For issues that remain equally ranked, priority is determined by the estimated effort: items requiring less effort are addressed first.
