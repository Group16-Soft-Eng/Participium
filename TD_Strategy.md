## Technical Debt Strategy
So far, we've dedicated 15% of the total time (around 15 hours) to technical debt related tasks, in particular code review.
From the next sprint, we've decided to split these 15 hours in the following way:
- 5 hours for code review
- 5 hours for bugfixing
- 5 hours for refactoring

### Priority
The highest priority is for the most important user stories: since the Technical Debt handling has started later in the process, the earlier stories must be completed first.

Additionally, the priority for in between the stories is computed in this way, from the highest to the lowest:
- Security
- Reliability
- Maintainability
