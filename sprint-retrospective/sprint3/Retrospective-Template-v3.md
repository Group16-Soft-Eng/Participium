TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 16)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done : 5 / 5
- Total points committed vs done : 31 / 31
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) : 2s 2d 30m / 2s 1d 7o 20m

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing: 774
- Code review completed: 5h
- Code present on VCS: 
- End-to-End tests performed: 

> Please refine your DoD
 
### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_  | 11      | -      | 1s 1g 15m  | 1s 7o 40m    |
| PT-24 | 7       | 3      | 7h         | 7h           |
| PT-25 | 6       | 2      | 5h 15m     | 5h 15m       |
| PT-26 | 9       | 13     | 1d 7h 30m  | 1d 4h 30m    |
| PT-27 | 8       | 5      | 1d         | 7h 55m       |
| PT-10 | 7       | 8      | 1d 30m     | 1g 1h 30m    |


> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation): 
  - average : about 1.86 
  - std dev: -- 
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 5h 15m
  - Total hours spent: 5h 15m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 518
  - Coverage (if available): ![alt text](unit_test_coverage.png)
- Integration testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 6h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 6h 25m
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 3h 30m
  - Total hours spent 3h 30m
- Code review:
  - Total hours estimated : 5h 
  - Total hours spent: 5h
- Technical Debt management:
  - Strategy adopted:
    > Hours split
    - 5 hours for code review
    - 5 hours for bugfixing
    - 5 hours for refactoring
    > Order priority
    - Security
    - Reliability
    - Maintainability

  - Total hours estimated estimated at sprint planning: 1d 7h
  - Total hours spent: 1d 7h 30m
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - No particular error in estimation

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - We learned to update each other more frequently
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - we reached a better comunication between internal groups especially before and after a task is respectively started or completed. 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - All the goal set from previous sprint have been satisfied
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - We're all getting along really well, this is contributing to accordingly have not so much to get improved as a team. 

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We're really prod of us as a team because we're confirming we can manage to complete each story and task in the backlog sprint in most of cases with really not significant time estimation errors
  - We're also proud to share that, as weeks pass by, we show more commitment as individual team members for the tasks each is involved into, This is showed through high availability and effort of each of us.
